# Employee_Salary_Prediction
Define the project goal – Predict employee salary using ML.
Collect the dataset – Use a CSV file with features like Age, Gender, Education Level, Job Title, 
Years of Experience, and Salary.
Preprocess the data
Handle missing values
Encode categorical variables using LabelEncoder
Split data into features (X) and target (y)
Split the dataset – Divide data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).
Select and train model – Use RandomForestRegressor to train on the dataset.
Evaluate the model – Use metrics like R² score and MSE to check performance.
Save the model – Use joblib to save the trained model as a .pkl file.
Create Streamlit web app – Design a user interface for input and output prediction.
Integrate model with Streamlit app – Load the model and predict salary based on user inputs.
Test the app locally – Run using streamlit run app.py.
